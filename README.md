# Image denoising

In this project, I have developed some variations of autoencoder architecture to explore the denoising capacity of them.

I employed the MNIST dataset and I added white noise tuned by a factor. The architecture used to denoise the image are deep autoencoder, sparse deep autoencoder and deep convolutional autoencoder.

The results are evaluated both visually and numerically, employing MSE and PSNR.
